      "performance for the year ended December 31, 2012. Please read it in conjunction with the Project's financial \n",
      "statements, which follow this section. \n",
      "Overview of the Financial Statements \n",
      "This discussion and analysis is intended to serve as an introduction to the Project’s basic financial statements. \n",
      "The Project's basic financial statements include three components: 1) government-wide financial statements, 2) \n",
      "governmental fund financial statements, and 3) notes to the financial statements. This report also contains other \n",
      "supplementary information concerning the expenditures by statutory code. \n",
      "Basic Financial Statements \n",
      "The basic financial statements include two kinds of financial statements that present different views of the \n",
      "Project — the Government-Wide Financial Statements and the Governmental Fund Financial Statements. These \n",
      "financial statements also include the notes to the financial statements that explain some of the information in the \n",

      "Government-Wide Financial Statements \n",
      "The government-wide financial statements provide both long-term and short-term information about the Project's \n",
      "financial status and use accounting methods similar to those used by private-sector companies. The statement \n",
      "of net assets includes all of the project's assets and liabilities. All of the current year’s revenues and expenses \n",
      "are accounted for in the statement of activities regardless of when cash is received or paid. The two \n",
      "government-wide statements report the Project's net assets and how they have changed. Net assets — the \n",
      "difference between the Project’s assets and liabilities — is one way to measure the Project’s financial health, or \n",
      "position. \n",
      "Governmental Fund Financial Statements \n",
      "The governmental fund financial statements provide more detailed information about the Project’s significant \n",
      "funds — not the Project as a whole. Governmental funds focus on: 1) how cash and other financial assets can \n",
      "readily be converted to cash flows and 2) the year-end balances that are available for spending. Consequently, \n",
      "the governmental fund statements provide a detailed short-term view that helps determine whether there are \n",
      "more financial resources that can be spent in the near future to finance the Project. Because this information \n",
      "does not encompass the additional long-term focus of the government-wide statements, we provide additional \n",
      "information at the bottom of the statements to explain the relationship (or differences) between them. \n",
