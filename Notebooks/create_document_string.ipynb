      "|. INTRODUCTION \n",
      "The 35th/Halsted Redevelopment Project Area (hereafter referred to as the \"Redevelopment Project \n",
      "Area\") is located on the near southwest side of the city of Chicago, approximately three to four miles \n",
      "from the central business district; much of it is encompassed by the Stockyards Industrial Corridor. \n",
      "The Redevelopment Project Area comprises approximately 518 acres \n",
      "and includes 63 (full and \n",
      "partial) city blocks. It is generally bounded by 31st and 35th Streets on the north; property fronting \n",
      "Morgan Street and Halsted Street, and the alley between Halsted and Emerald Streets on the east; \n",
      "Pershing Road on the south; and Ashland and Damen Avenues on the west. The boundaries of the \n",
      "Redevelopment Project Area are shown on Map 1, Redevelopment Project Boundary. \n",
      "The Redevelopment Project Area is located within a larger community that was once a major \n",
      "industrial center that included the Union Stock Yards and the Central Manufacturing District(CMD). \n",
      "Its development patterns reflect these earlier land uses. Today, the Redevelopment Project Area \n",
      "still contains primarily industrial, residential, commercial, and institutional land uses. It continues to \n",
      "be well suited for these types of land applications. \n",
      "The Redevelopment Project Area is well situated within the broader community. It is located near \n",
      "the city’s central business district and in proximity to an excellent regional surface transportation \n",
      "network. The Dan Ryan Expressway (Interstate 90/94) is located less than a mile east of the \n",
      "Redevelopment Project Area with access points at both 35th Street and Pershing Road. Through \n",
      "the use of Pershing Road, 31st Street, 35th Street, Ashland Avenue, and Damen Avenue, the \n",
      "Stevenson (Interstate 55) and the Eisenhower (Interstate 290) expressway’ are located within two \n",
      "to four miles, respectively, from the Redevelopment Project Area. \n",
      "The major local access routes serving the Redevelopment Project Area include Pershing Road, \n",
      "31st Street, 35th Street, Halsted Street, and Ashiand Avenue. Additionally, the Redevelopment \n",
      "Project Area is well served by public transportation making the site easily accessible to the local \n",
      "work force. The CTA maintains a station nearby at 35th Street on the rapid transit line that runs \n",
      "along the Dan Ryan Expressway, and at Archer Avenue and Halsted Street along the southwest \n",
      "rapid transit line. Also, public transportation is available via CTA buses along Pershing Road, 31st \n",
      "Street, 35th Street, Halsted Street, and Ashland Avenue. \n",
      "While the Redevelopment Project Area has certain assets, its liabilities are significant and have \n",
      "inhibited the area's overall redevelopment (Exhibit 1). Much of the Redevelopment Project Area is \n",
      "characterized by: \n",
      "e vacant land; \n",
      "vacant buildings, many of which are obsolete due to their old age and design (i.e., multi- \n",
      "story/single-user); \n",
      "« outmoded platting; \n",

      "The Redevelopment Project Area is situated within two of Chicago's 77 community areas. The \n",
      "portion east of the Chicago River is located within Bridgeport which is bounded by the Chicago River \n",
      "on the north, the C. & railroad right-of-way on the east, Pershing Road on the south, and the \n",
      "Chicago River on the west. The portion located west of the Chicago River is part of the McKinley \n",

      "way on the west. \n",
      "The early development of both of these communities was influenced primarily by the completion of \n",
      "the Illinois and Michigan Canal in 1848, the Union Stock Yards in 1865, and the Central \n",
      "Manufacturing District in 1908 and 1916. The industrial, residential, commercial, and institutional \n",
      "land use patterns currently reflected within the Redevelopment Project Area are representative of \n",
      "the development patterns that were established early on. \n",
      "The industrial uses are still concentrated south of 35th Street between Haisted and Ashland in the \n",
      "area of the original CMD which was bounded by 35th Street on the north, Morgan Street on the \n",

      "Bridgeport \n",
      "According to the 1980 Loca! Community Fact Book, Bridgeport became a boomtown in 1848 as a \n",
      "result of the completion of the Illinois and Michigan Canal which linked the City of Chicago with the \n",
      "Mississippi River. Canal-related industries and businesses flocked to the area which was \n",
      "conveniently located near this.water transportation route. As stated in the Local Community Fact \n",
      "Book, “The chief industry was meat-slaughtering which utilized the ready supply of water in the \n",

      "Yards, the meat packers moved south and west of the yards, encouraged by improved railroad \n",
      "facilities in these locations. \n",
      "As a result of these early developments, residential and commercial areas grew within the \n",
      "Bridgeport community. By the late 1800's, a small shopping district emerged at the intersection of \n",

      ". . an \n",
      "electric trolley system was introduced in the area, streets were paved, and other public \n",

      "By the early 1900's, the Bridgeport community's industrial base expanded to include part of the CMD \n",
      "which was the first planned industrial development in the United States. According to the Urban \n",
      "Land Institute's /ndustria! Development Handbook, the development was spearheaded by \n",

      "The author of Chicago: City of Neighborhoods states that “In 1902, a group of investors headed by \n",

      "of tax increment financing to facilitate redevelopment. \n",
      "McKinley Park \n",
      "McKinley Park is located directly west of Bridgeport and is situated northwestof the old Union Stock \n",
      "Yards site. McKinley Park was originally settled by laborers working on the lilinois and Michigan \n",
      "Canal. The author of Chicago: City of Neighborhoods states that \"The area quickly developed from \n",
      "a small farming community to an industrial center as Chicago reached out from its origins at the \n",
      "mouth of the river to transform its immediate hinteriand.° \n",
      "According to the 1980 Local Community Fact Book, significant development of McKinley Park did \n",
      "not occur until 1863 when it was incorporated into the limits of the City of Chicago. Once the Union \n",
      "Stock Yards opened in 1865, workers were attracted to the community. However, the community \n",
      "did not experience rapid growth until the 1880's and 1890's. \n",
      "By the turn of the century, most McKinley Park residents were employed in the meatpacking \n",
      "industry. Later employment opportunities were available as a result of the development of the CMD \n",
      "bounded by 35th Street on the north, Morgan Street on the east, Pershing Road on the south, and \n",
      "Ashland Avenue on the west. \n",
      "Because of the success of the original CMD development site (the East District), a new area was \n",
      "developed (the Pershing Road District) in 1916 along the south side of Pershing Road between \n",
      "Ashland and Western Avenues. According to Chicago: City of Neighborhoods, “The new buildings \n",
      "stood on land bordering the Chicago Junction Railway's classification yards. This was crucial \n",
